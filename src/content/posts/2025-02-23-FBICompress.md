**FBICompress** is a powerful image compression tool that utilizes [compressor.io](https://compressor.io) to reduce image sizes while maintaining quality. It supports **JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WEBP** formats. The script leverages **cloudscraper** to bypass Cloudflare protection and requires **valid proxies** to avoid rate limits.

## ‚ú® Features  
‚úÖ Compress entire image folders  
‚úÖ Supports **lossy** and **lossless** compression  
‚úÖ Automatically fetches and verifies proxies  
‚úÖ Option to overwrite original images  
‚úÖ **Bypasses compressor.io limitations**  

## üõ°Ô∏è Bypassing Restrictions  
By default, **compressor.io** enforces:  
- **50 images per day limit**  
- **Maximum 10 images per batch**  

**FBICompress** bypasses these restrictions by:  
- **Rotating proxies** to prevent detection  
- **Utilizing multiple concurrent threads**  
- **Using Cloudscraper** to evade Cloudflare protection  

This exploit takes advantage of a **cybersecurity vulnerability** in the platform‚Äôs rate-limiting system.  

‚ö† **This may violate compressor.io‚Äôs Terms of Service. Use responsibly!**  

## üîß Requirements
- **Python 3.6+**  
- **Cloudscraper library** (`pip install cloudscraper`)  
- **Active internet connection**  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Install **Python 3.6+**  
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install cloudscraper
   ```
3. Download and run the script.  

## üöÄ Usage
Basic compression:  
```bash
python FBICompress.py /path/to/images
```
Lossless compression:  
```bash
python FBICompress.py /path/to/images -t lossless
```
Save compressed images in a different directory:  
```bash
python FBICompress.py /path/to/images -o /path/to/compressed
```
Overwrite original images:  
```bash
python FBICompress.py /path/to/images -o /path/to/images --overwrite
```
