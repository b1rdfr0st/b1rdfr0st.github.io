Websites often use cookies to track user activity, sometimes impacting privacy and security. One example is Kariyer.netâ€™s `jobviewcount` cookie, which limits job views and encourages user registration. Let's examine its function and how to bypass it. [Blog](https://fr0stb1rd.pages.dev/posts/Bypass-Kariyer.net-Signup-Warning/) \| [Souce Code](https://gitlab.com/fr0stb1rd/bypass-kariyer-net-signup-warning) \| [Script](https://greasyfork.org/tr/scripts/527319-bypass-kariyer-net-signup-warning)

## Understanding the `jobviewcount` Cookie

The `jobviewcount` cookie on [Kariyer.net](https://www.kariyer.net/) tracks the number of job postings a user views. After **three views**, a sign-up prompt appears, restricting further access.

### How It Works:
1. The cookie increments with each job view:

2. At **three views**, a registration prompt blocks further browsing:

3. The restriction resets after signing up or clearing cookies.

## Security & Privacy Concerns

### Tracking Risks:
- Websites monitor user behavior through cookies.
- Data may be shared or sold to third parties.

### User Limitations:
- Forced registration disrupts the browsing experience.
- Data collection can lead to targeted ads and profiling.

## Protecting Your Privacy

- **Use Incognito Mode**: Prevents cookies from being stored.
- **Clear Cookies Regularly**: Resets tracking data.
- **Disable Third-Party Cookies**: Reduces tracking risks.
- **Use Privacy-Focused Browsers**: Limits data collection.

## Bypassing the Restriction with Tampermonkey

For users who wish to bypass the `jobviewcount` restriction, a simple Tampermonkey script can automatically reset the cookie.

### Installing Tampermonkey

Before you can use the script, you need to install the Tampermonkey extension. Tampermonkey is a popular user script manager that allows you to run custom scripts in your browser.

1. Install Tampermonkey for your browser:
   - **[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)**
   - **[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)**
   - **[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)**
   - **[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)**

2. Once installed, you should see the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar.
3. Now you can proceed with adding the script.

### Quick Install:
[Download from GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/tr/scripts/527319-bypass-kariyer-net-signup-warning)

### Tampermonkey Script:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Bypass Kariyer.net Signup Warning
// @namespace    Violentmonkey Scripts
// @run-at       document-start
// @author       fr0stb1rd
// @noframes
// @version      1.1
// @match        https://www.kariyer.net/*
// @description  Removes the jobviewcount cookie on Kariyer.net to bypass job view limits
// @license      GPL-3.0
// @homepageURL  https://gitlab.com/fr0stb1rd/bypass-kariyer-net-signup-warning

(function() {
    document.cookie = "jobviewcount=; path=/; domain=kariyer.net;";
})();
```

This script resets the `jobviewcount` cookie, preventing the site from enforcing job view limits.

## Conclusion

The `jobviewcount` cookie is a standard tracking method used to enforce registration. While it benefits businesses, users should be aware of its privacy implications and take measures to protect their data.
