### Ready Command Texts for BotFather

To easily set up your bot, you can use the following command texts to copy and paste into BotFather:

1. **Create a new bot:**
   ```
   /newbot
   ```

2. **Set your bot's username:**
   ```
   YourBotUsername
   ```

3. **Set your bot's display name:**
   ```
   Your Bot Display Name
   ```

### `env.USERS` Usage

The `env.USERS` variable is used to specify which users are allowed to interact with the bot. This is useful if you want to make the bot private and restrict its usage to a specific set of users. 

- **Adding Users**: To add users, you need to include their Telegram user IDs in the `USERS` array in the `wrangler.json` file. For example:
  ```json
  "USERS": [123456789, 987654321]
  ```

- **Empty Array**: If you leave the `USERS` array empty, the bot will be public and any user can interact with it.
  ```json
  "USERS": []
  ```

    ### Usage Scenarios:

    1. **Private Bot Mode**:
        - If you want to make the bot private, add your user ID to `env.USERS`.
        - Only the users listed in `env.USERS` will be able to interact with the bot.
        - If a user not listed in `env.USERS` tries to use the bot, they will receive a message saying "‚õîÔ∏è You are not authorized to use this bot."

    2. **Public Bot Mode**:
        - If `env.USERS` is an empty array or not defined, the bot will be public.
        - Any user will be able to interact with the bot without restrictions.

    3. **Database Check**:
        - If `env.USERS` is defined and not empty, the bot will also check if the user exists in the database.
        - If the user is not found in the database, they will receive a message saying "‚õîÔ∏è You are not authorized to use this bot."

    4. **Banned Users**:
        - Regardless of the `env.USERS` configuration, the bot will check if the user is banned.
        - If the user is banned, they will receive a message saying "You are banned from using this bot."

    ### Example:

    ```typescript
    const env: Env = {
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: 'your-telegram-bot-token',
    WEBHOOK_URL: 'your-webhook-url',
    LOG_CHANNEL_ID: 123456789,
    DB: yourDatabaseInstance,
    OWNER_ID: 987654321,
    USERS: [123456789, 987654321] // Only these users can use the bot
    };
    ```

    In this example, only the users with IDs `123456789` and `987654321` will be able to use the bot.

    ```bash
    /set -1001234567890 -1009876543210 ban

    ```bash

    /enable -1001234567890 -1009876543210
    ```

- Disable a rule:

    /disable -1001234567890 -1009876543210
    ```

    /list
    ```

- Only authorized users can manage rules
- Webhook URL is protected with a secret path
- All database operations are parameterized to prevent SQL injection

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Bot not responding**
   - Check if bot token is correct
   - Verify webhook is set properly
   - Ensure bot has required permissions

2. **Rule management failure**  
   - Verify bot is admin in both groups.
   - Check if the rule format is correct.
   - Look for errors in worker logs.
