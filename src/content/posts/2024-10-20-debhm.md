## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/fr0stb1rd/debhm.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd debhm
   ```
3. Fetch the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. Enter two numbers in the provided input fields.
2. Choose one of the operations: `+`, `-`, `X`, or `รท`.
3. The result will be displayed immediately.

### Important Notes

- The app prevents non-numeric input by filtering the input fields to accept digits only.
- Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message: "Error: Division by zero!"
